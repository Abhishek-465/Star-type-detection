![Star Type Detection](https://github.com/Abhishek-465/Star-type-detection/assets/127030695/ae152917-ea66-44be-9464-83e251a06b8a)

## Overview

This project uses machine learning to detect the type of stars based on certain input features. The model is built using Scikit-learn, Numpy, and Pandas.


## Features

- Predicts the type of stars based on input features.
- Uses a machine learning model built with Scikit-learn.
- Data preprocessing with Numpy and Pandas.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various features of stars that help in determining their types. The features include:

- Temperature
- Luminosity
- Radius
- Absolute Magnitude
- Star Color
- Spectral Class

## Model

The machine learning model used in this project is built with Scikit-learn. Various algorithms were tested to find the best performing model for star type detection.
